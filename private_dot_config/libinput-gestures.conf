# Minimal gesture support

# 3-finger horizontal swipe: switch workspaces (auto-creates new ones)
gesture swipe right 3 ~/.config/sway/workspace-swipe.sh prev
gesture swipe left 3 ~/.config/sway/workspace-swipe.sh next

# 3-finger up: workspace overview (Sway doesn't have built-in expo view)
# Uncomment if you install a workspace switcher like swayr
# gesture swipe up 3 swayr switch-workspace
